EduMatch was set up to act as a bridge to connect students to the right tutors. Most of the digital platforms for
private tutors are mostly held virtually in our community. In our community, usually tutors are only able to expand 
their classes through word of mouth or through an agency, which consists of a commission fee to the agency. We wanted to
set up a platform to connect students and tutors based on their requirements and schedule, with direct communication between each other taking no commissions on our side.

To run the project -
